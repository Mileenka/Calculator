## Code Quality Checks ‚úîÔ∏è

- `npm run format`: Makes sure all the code in this repository is well-formatted
  (looks good).
- `npm run format:check`: Checks the code formatting in the project without
  making any actual changes. It verifies if the code follows a specified
  formatting style, such as indentation, spacing, and line breaks. It helps
  ensure code consistency and adherence to the defined coding standards.
- `npm run lint:js`: Checks for any syntax errors, coding style violations, or
  potential bugs. It enforces a consistent code style and helps identify and fix
  issues early in the development process.
- `npm run lint:ls`: Checks to make sure all folder and file names match the
  repository conventions.
- `npm run lint:md`: Will lint all of the Markdown files in this repository.
- `npm run spell-check`: Goes through all the files in this repository looking
  for words it doesn't recognize. Just because it says something is a mistake
  doesn't mean it is! It doesn't know every word in the world. You can add new
  correct words to the [./.cspell.json](./.cspell.json) file so they won't cause
  an error.
